## Human(e) Tech
First, a breath. One inhale, one exhale. A moment held. 

For a long time, one answer seemed simple. Innovate. The assumption was: *innovation is always good. **So more is always bette***. You don’t have to be good. Just clever. Then came screen addiction; zoom exhaustion; constant surveillance; misinformation; broken democracy; commodified friendship; lost intimacy; and the erosion of creativity, thoughtfulness, and wonder.

To counter this erosion of creativity, thoughtfulness, and wonder, we will collaboratively design, host, and facilitate a series of three online Human(e) Tech Design Studios that draw on tools and techniques pioneered as part of participatory action research, in combination with facilitated practices of codesign. These studios will generate playful, yet incisive encounters, that allow participants to explore how their theoretical labors might be made actionable within the very innovation-minded communities those labors often seek to critically address. Our immediate goal is to provide tools, methodologies, and modalities to enrich and put into action critical humanities scholarship on the failings and risks of ubiquitous digital technologies. And we believe that in fulfilling this goal we contribute to the longer-term goal of incorporating the wisdom of those who study human lives and values into digital culture—to put the humanities “in the room where it happens,” as the musical Hamilton states it.
