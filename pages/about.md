## Human(e) Tech
First, a breath. One inhale, one exhale. A moment held. 

For a long time, one answer seemed simple. Innovate. The assumption was: *innovation is always good. **So more is always bette***. You don’t have to be good. Just clever. Then came screen addiction; zoom exhaustion; constant surveillance; misinformation; broken democracy; commodified friendship; lost intimacy; and the erosion of creativity, thoughtfulness, and wonder.

The contradictions of innovation don’t call for better innovation. ***They call for deeper change***.
